Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
python gives error if skip identation.


Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Example:
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0



You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'


Variable names are case-sensitive.
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
