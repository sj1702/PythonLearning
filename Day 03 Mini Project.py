Additionally, provide a message indicating whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the calculated BMI.

# Provide a message indicating the BMI category based on the following ranges:
# Underweight: BMI < 18.5
# Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
# Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
# Obesity: BMI >= 30
